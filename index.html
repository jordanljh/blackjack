<!--  All HTML files begin with the following line: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- This indicates that the rest of the lines that follow are to be interpreted as HTML. It tells the browser about what document type to expect. -->

<!-- All text enclosed in angled brackets are known as HTML element tags. There are usually, but not always, starting and closing element "tags", each representing a HTML element.
The <html> element is known as the root element of a HTML page. All other elements are encased within it. -->
<html>
  <!-- The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page, information that is not rendered or displayed by the browser -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab) and is the default name given to a bookmark of a webpage. -->
    <title>Basics</title>
    <!-- The <link> element specifies a relationship between this HTML page and an external resource, namely the styles.css file here. In this case, we are linking a stylesheet which is a CSS file containing information relating to the layout and style of the webpage. The syntax within the styles.css file is also referred to as CSS - Cascading Style Sheets. -->

  <!-- The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents that will be rendered by the browser.  -->

    <!-- The <nav> tag semantically defines a set of navigation links. It doesn't have many properties different from a <div>, and exists purely for semantic naming. -->
    <nav>
      <!-- The <ul> tag represents an unordered list, where items in the list are rendered on a vertical bulleted list. While we are listing the days of the exercises on this navbar, we are positioning them horizontally without the bullets. This is done using CSS, and you can preview the syntax in styles.css (do a search for "nav ul"). -->
